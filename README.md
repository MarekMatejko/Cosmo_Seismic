# Correlations between secondary cosmic ray detection rates and seismic effects

- **“Observation of large scale precursor correlations between cosmic rays and earthquakes”** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12310)  article shows us the correlations between secondary cosmic ray detection rates and seismic effects. 

- **Our purpose is finding better correlations** for Oulu station shown in Fig.2 in the article for new  t0 and d. Function P<sub>PDF</sub>  and his variables which we use to find correlations is described in the article.

- **Cosmic ray data** we can find in the https://www.nmdb.eu/nest/ website. Five minutes data from *oulu_2007_pres_corr_5min.txt* has been delivered by the Institute of Nuclear Physics Polish Academy of Science.

- **Earthquake magnitude data** we can find in the https://earthquake.usgs.gov/ website.
